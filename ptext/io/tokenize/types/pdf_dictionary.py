    A dictionary object is an associative table containing pairs of objects, known as the dictionaryâ€™s entries. The first
    element of each entry is the key and the second element is the value. The key shall be a name (unlike
    dictionary keys in PostScript, which may be objects of any type). The value may be any kind of object, including
    another dictionary. A dictionary entry whose value is null (see 7.3.9, "Null Object") shall be treated the same as
    if the entry does not exist. (This differs from PostScript, where null behaves like any other object as the value
    of a dictionary entry.) The number of entries in a dictionary shall be subject to an implementation limit; see
    Annex C. A dictionary may have zero entries.

    The entries in a dictionary represent an associative table and as such shall be unordered even though an
    arbitrary order may be imposed upon them when written in a file. That ordering shall be ignored.
